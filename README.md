 **Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
 
During this project, I created a Q-learning algorithm
I was given code that created a maze, a neural network that determined if the maze had been solved, the python code which ran the game, and the other assets' experience reward algorithm. 
I created the code which learned how to solve the maze using these tools. This code is located in the ipybn file, in the qmaze() function. 

    **Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
    
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are responsible for solving computer-related problems. This can be in novel ways or utilizing well-researched paths. 

    **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
    
I approach problems like a computer scientist by conducting research about the problems I am presented with. I then analyze the issue through the lens of what has been done before, and what the needed solution is. Depending on the situation I implement a solution that is ideal based on the factors.

    **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
    
My ethical responsibilities are to both the end user, and the organization. In order to properly evaluate the ethics of a situation, it's important to consider multiple aspects. The end user of a system should be thought of in matters of data privacy, system security, and bias. The organization should be thought of in matters of integrity, diligence, and network security. It is important to consider the ethics surrounding the software that is being created and the impact that it will have on both end users and organizations.
